T = Time complexity, S = Space complexity

Task0:

- open, csv.reader
    T: O(1), S: O(1) because it just prepares files for reading

- list(reader):
    T: O(1) prepares lists
    S: O(N) has to load N records in memory
    
- texts[0][0]
    T: O(1), S: O(1) python list != linkedlist so accessing element is constant
